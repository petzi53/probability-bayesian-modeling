That is, all probabilities are non-negative values.\n- **Axiom 2**: $P(S) = 1$. That is, the probability that you observe something in the sample space is one.\n- **Axiom 3**: Suppose one has a sequence of events $A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3},…$ that are mutually exclusive, which means that for any two events in the sequence, say $A_{2}$ and $A_{3}$, the intersection of the two events is the empty set (i.e. $A_{2} \\cap A_{3} = 0$). Then one finds the probability of the union of the events by adding the individual event probabilities:\n\n\n$$P(A_{1} \\cup A_{2} \\cup A_{3}…) = P(A_{1}) + P(A_{2}) + P(A_{3}) + …$$ {#eq-axiom3}\n\n## The Complement and Addition Properties\n\n**Complement Property**: \n\n$$P(\\overline{A}) = 1 - P(A)$$ {#eq-complement}\n\n**Addition Property**: \n\n$$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$$ {#eq-addition}\n\n\n## Exercises\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nPlease keep in mind that I am a learner!

Why? **Yes, because there is only 25% of a 4 package purchase where more than 1 poster is missing. Also the figures only say how much posters are missing but do not say which kind of poster is missing. Therefore we can assume that -- _if_ there are missing poster -- that these are always different kind of posters.**\n\n### Writing Sample Spaces 1\n\nFor the following random experiments, give an appropriate sample space for the random experiment.
